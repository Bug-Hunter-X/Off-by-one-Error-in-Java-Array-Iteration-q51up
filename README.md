This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration and its solution.  The `Bug.java` file contains code with the error, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version. The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an element outside the array's valid index range. This can lead to runtime exceptions. The solution adjusts the loop condition to avoid the out-of-bounds access.
